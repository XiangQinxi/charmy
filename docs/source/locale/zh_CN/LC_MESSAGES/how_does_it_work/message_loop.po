"If you only use single-threaded synchronous task execution, it will cause"
" the interface to lag. To avoid this problem, we need to use "
"``asynchronous`` or ``multithreading`` methods."

"Here it is divided into the working thread and the UI thread. The UI "
"thread is the main thread. When using the ``cm.mainloop`` method, the "
"main thread will continuously refresh and render the UI. If we handle "
"multiple events that need refreshing (similar to the problematic "
"``glfw_set_char_callback`` method, where text input processing triggers "
"repeatedly, giving one character at a time), it can cause noticeable lag "
"because each handling will refresh and redraw the window. Therefore, "
"methods that occupy the main thread like this should be handed over to "
"the working thread to process. The working thread handles each event in "
"turn, preventing multiple redundant refresh tasks from being processed at"
" once."
