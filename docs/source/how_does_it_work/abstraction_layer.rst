Abstraction layer
=================
Because ``Charmy GUI`` supports `multiple backend and frontend libraries`,
we need to ``abstract`` their methods so they can switch between them at any time.

So we can use the map method to map the methods of the backend library to the methods of the frontend library.

.. code-block:: python

   method_map: dict[Backend, typing.Callable] = {}

Then, by checking whether a certain library is installed, add the mapping method. Let's use create() as an example.

.. code-block:: python

   class GLFWBackend:
       def create(self):
           pass

   import importlib.util
   if importlib.util.find_spec("glfw"):
       method_map[Backend.GLFW] = GLFWBackend

It's the same for other libraries as well.

.. code-block:: python

   class SDL3Backend:
       def create(self):
           pass

   import importlib.util
   if importlib.util.find_spec("sdl3"):
       method_map[Backend.SDL3] = SDL3Backend

Then, we can execute the corresponding framework's methods through the mapping table and the selected framework name.

.. code-block:: python

   backend = Backend.GLFW  # or Backend.SDL3
   window = method_map[backend].create()

That's the principle of the abstraction layer. Next, you can delve deeper through the source code and testing.
