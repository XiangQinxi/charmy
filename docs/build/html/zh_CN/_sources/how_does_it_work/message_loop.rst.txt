Message Loop (Event Loop)
=========================
If you only use single-threaded synchronous task execution,
it will cause the interface to lag.
To avoid this problem, we need to use ``asynchronous`` or ``multithreading`` methods.

Currently, events are mainly handled using **synchronous single-threading** (with optional multithreading).

    graph TD
    A[Single-Threaded Event Loop] --> B{Is there any task??}
    B -- Yes --> C[Waiting for excuting these tasks]
    B -- No --> D[Wait for 2ms]
    D --> B

Multithreading
--------------
Here it is divided into the working thread and the UI thread.
The UI thread is the main thread.
When using the ``cm.mainloop`` method, the main thread will continuously refresh and render the UI.
If we handle multiple events that need refreshing (similar to the problematic ``glfw_set_char_callback`` method,
where text input processing triggers repeatedly, giving one character at a time),
it can cause noticeable lag because each handling will refresh and redraw the window.
Therefore, methods that occupy the main thread like this should be handed over to the working thread to process.
The working thread handles each event in turn,
preventing multiple redundant refresh tasks from being processed at once.

First, rewrite ``threading.Thread`` as an working thread.

.. code-block:: python

   import charmy as cm

   class EventThread(threading.Thread):
       tasks: list[Callable] = []  # Event tasks
       is_alive: bool = False

       def add_task(self, event: cm.Event, target: typing.Callable):
           self.tasks.append((event, target))

       def run(self):
           self.is_alive = True
           while self.is_alive:
               self.execute_tasks()
               if len(self.tasks) == 0:
                   # If idle, then rest for 0.02s to save CPU time
                   time.sleep(0.02)

       def execute_tasks(self):
           self.lock.acquire()  # Lock the task list to prevent multiple threads from accessing it at the same time
           for task in self.tasks:
               if callable(task[1].target):
                   task[1].target(task[0])
               elif isinstance(task[1], collections.abc.Iterable):
                   # Function list
                   for func in task[1]:
                       func(task[0])
               self.tasks.remove(task)
           else:
               # warnings.warn("")
               pass
           self.lock.release()

Then, create and run the thread through ``CmManager`` until the main thread finishes.
